Interactive Video Game Sales Dashboard (Tableau)
An interactive Tableau dashboard that explores global video game sales data across genres, platforms, publishers, and years.

Sales Over Time → Peak sales between 2000–2010, highlighting the dominance of DS, Wii, and PlayStation eras.
Top Titles → Pokémon Red/Blue tops with 10.22M global sales, alongside classics like Super Mario Bros. and Tetris.
Top Platforms → DS (175M), 3DS, PSP, and PS3 emerge as leaders, showing handhelds’ importance in global sales.
Top Publishers → Nintendo dominates with 455M sales, far ahead of Namco Bandai, Konami, and Capcom.
Dynamic Filters → Slice data by year, region, genre, or platform to uncover trends interactively.
